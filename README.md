# pyHangman
A terminal based hangman game made in Python.
There is an example custom wordslist called places.json included, but feel free to make your own.
Also, if running in Windows command prompt, you may have to change os.system('clear') to os.system('cls'), but I have not been able to test this as I don't use Windows.
